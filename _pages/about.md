Hello :) 

I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn). My supervisor is [Dr. Wenqiang Zhang](http://www.fudanroilab.com/2021/07/01/WenqiangZhang.html) and thank him for his multi-faceted supports. Before going to Fudan, I received the B.S. degree in computer science from [East China Normal University](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn) at 2018. 

My research interests include **Code Intelligence** and **Natural Language Generation**. The intersection of natural language processing and software engineering is my favorite area of research lately.
